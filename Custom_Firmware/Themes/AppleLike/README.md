------------------
   Compatibility
------------------

This Theme will only work with AUTOKIT **CUSTOM** Firmware ! (12.5MB rootFS required)

- You can tell if you already on the AUTOKIT Version if you have the Red Style UI. If you have the Blue UI, you will 
need to flash to the AUTOKIT Custom Firmware. Proceed at your own risk. 

- This UI Theme will NOT work on NON-AUTOKIT (Blue UI) firmware as different calls are made for the UI and different images are used.

- You will only be on a Custom firmware if you flashed it yourself, if you did not flash it, then it's on stock FW. You 
will not be able to get access to the file system.

------------------
 Important Notes
------------------

- This theme is fully compatible with 800x480, 1920x720 and 1280x720 displays. If you are on another resolution you will still see the updated colors/images but elements will not be moved.  This means some things may not look correct. 

- Full theme support is provided for 800x480, 1920x720 and 1280x820 resolutions.

- If you upgrade or change firmware the ui.tar.gz will be reverted to the stock file and you will need to install it again. 

- Only English is supported in this UI.
