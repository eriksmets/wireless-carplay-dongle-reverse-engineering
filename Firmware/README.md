### Official Firmwares (stock)

Put the firmware you want to flash inside the root directory of a USB drive formated in FAT32 and rename it U2W_Update.img (or U2W_SYD_Update.img if you are on 2020.08.27 or U2W_AUTOKIT_Update.img if you are on 2020.12.25).

Power the dongle (not from the car) and wait till the red light is solid before inserting the USB drive.

#### Warning: Official 2021.03.06 can only be downgraded using U2W_Update_2020.11.10.2138_ROLLBACK.img
